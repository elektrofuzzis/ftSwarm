    "description": "# NOTE: This is the core library used to develop the different ftSwarm-<Platform>-Libraries. Please use them instead! \nThe goal of the ftSwarm project is to build small networked controllers for DIY and toy applications. Since they are networked with each other, they can act like a swarm. For example, they can act as several independent robots to solve a task together. In larger models, the controllers can be installed at different positions close to actuators and sensors - together they control the complete model.",
