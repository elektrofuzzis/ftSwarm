# Swarm Dash

## Development

With Node.js and Yarn installed, run:

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

to start the frontend development server.

For the backend, run:

```bash
cd test-server
pip install -r requirements.txt
python server.py
```

## Deployment

To deploy the frontend, run:

```bash
yarn dist
```

This should automatically deploy the frontend to the sfs_files files in the arduino sketch.
