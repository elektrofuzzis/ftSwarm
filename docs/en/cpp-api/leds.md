The firmware provides three basic classes to run lamps, LEDs and the ftSwarmControl's builtin OLED display.

- Use [FtSwarmLamp](../FtSwarmLamp) for all types of *fischertechnik* Lamps and LEDs connected to M1 and M2 outputs.
- Use [FtSwarmLED](../FtSwarmPixel) for ftSwarm's builtin RGB-LEDs or external connected ftPixels.
- Use [FtSwarmOLED](../FtSwarmOLED) for ftSwarmControl's builtin OLED display.
