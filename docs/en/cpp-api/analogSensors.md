These sensors are measuring analog signals like light intensity using the photo transistor or temperature by NTC.

Most of *fischertechnik* analog sensors have to pins. These need to be connected to the controllers input pins. Some sensors have a red marked pin. Connect the marked pin to the red cable at ftSwarm/ftSwarmControl, use the signal input pin at ftSwarmRS.

Check [ftSwarm](/en/gettingstarted/1stftSwarm) and [ftSwarmControl](/en/gettingstarted/1stftSwarmControl) pinouts for more details.

**ftSwarmControl:** You could just use FTSWARM_A1 with analog sensors.<br><br>
**ftSwarm:** You could use all inputs with analog sensors. Additionally you could measure voltage at FTSWARM_A2.
