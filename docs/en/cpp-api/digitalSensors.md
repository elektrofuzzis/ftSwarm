Digital sensors are switches, they only know two values: on and off.

Most of *fischertechnik* digital sensors have to pins. These need to be connected to the controllers input pins. Some sensors have a red marked pin. Connect the marked pin to the red cable at ftSwarm/ftSwarmControl, use the signal input pin at ftSwarmRS.

Check [ftSwarm](/en/gettingstarted/1stftSwarm) and [ftSwarmControl](/en/gettingstarted/1stftSwarmControl) pinouts for more details.
