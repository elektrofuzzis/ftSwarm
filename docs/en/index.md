The goal of the ftSwarm project is to build small networked controllers for DIY and toy applications. 
Since they are networked with each other, they can act like a swarm. For example, they can act as several independent robots to solve a task together. 
In larger models, the controllers can be installed at different positions close to actuators and sensors - together they control the complete model.

Originally, the project was designed to use with *fischertechnik*. Since the mounting grooves are compatible with Makerbeam profiles, ftSwarms could be used in many DIY projects.

| As a control panel, the ftSwarmControl has, in addition to 2 joysticks, 8 buttons and an LCD display, the ability to control 2 DC motors and read 4 digital sensors.| ![ftSwarmControl](/assets/img/ftSwarmControl_small.png) | 

Since building this hardware on your own is a little bit tricky, we offer ready to use devices at [gundermann-software.de](https://gundermann-software.de/).
For all who wants to build their own pcb, we provide the needed schematic files at github as well.
