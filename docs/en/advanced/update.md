## Update Your Firmware

In general updating the firmware is very easy. The firmware is an Arduino sketch, so you need to compile & upload it using the Arduino IDE.
If you didn't work with the Arduino IDE yet, read [Arduino IDE](../cpp/ide/arduino) first.

1. Remore your old ftSwarm-Library.
Delete the folder ftSwarm in Arduino/libraries.

2. Download and install new ftSwarm.zip. Check [Arduino IDE](../cpp/ide/arduino) for details.

3. Check your Arduino IDE settings.

4. Download firmware.zip and install it in your Ardino folder.

5. Open firmware.ino with your Arduino IDE.

6. Compile & Upload the firmware.

*Keep in mind to run all devices in your swarm on the same firmware version.*
