Getting started is a tutorial in using your swarm. To understand ftSwarm programming and principles, you should read this tutorial step by step: 

1. Learn about pinout & tech specs of [ftSwarm](../1stftSwarm) and [ftSwarmControl](../1stftSwarmControl)
2. [Connect your ftSwarm controller with your PC](../serial)
3. [Configure wifi and use the status page](../WebUI)
4. [Install IDE to run the examples](../ide)
5. [Run your first program on a singular controller](../MotorSwitch)
6. [Understand the kelda principle to run a swarm](../kelda)
7. [The first swarm](../MotorSwitchSwarm)
8. [How to use buttons, switches and toggles](../switches)
9. [Use alias names to structure your code](../MotorSwitchAlias)
10. [Remote control without a line of code](../RemoteControl)
11. [Use events to simplfy your code](../EventControlled)
12. [RGB LEDs & ftPixel](../FtSwarmPixel)
13. [OLED Display](../FtSwarmOLED)

The tutorial is not intended to explain everything in detail. If you like to have a deep dive into ftSwarm's commands & features please checkout the [API](../cpp-api/index.md) documentation.

### Intended Use & Warranty

The ftSwarm project to build small networked controllers for DIY and toy applications. 
This project gives you the needed hard- and software. But it's your project and you need to take care of your project.

- Hobbyist projects need to be supervised all time.
- Don't build robotics, which could harm humans, pets or anything else.
- This project is not intended to build professional robotics.
- You need to test the provided hard- and software on your own, to assure the needed functionality and stability of your hobbyist project.

Our hard- and software is engineered as a hobbyist project. So it has built-in errors and limitations.
Therefore we exclude any warranty on the hardware and software presented here.
