## Writing C++ Applications

To write C++ applications, you could need an IDE and a platform. In this tutorial we show how to use the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/),
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/).

Later, we explain the programming basics using some example code. This code is shown and explained in the page's text.
You don't need to cut it out of the text. During the install procedures of the ftSwarm framework, the examples are deployed to your computer, too.

Let's start and install your environment.
